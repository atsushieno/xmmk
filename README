Xmmk: cross-platform virtual MIDI keyboard
------------------------------------------

Xmmk is a tiny virtual MIDI keyboard application based on managed-midi API.
(It is mostly managed-midi API dogfooding.)

For Windows users
-----------------

Xmmk.csproj does not reference Xwt.WPF by default. You most likely want it.

When building Xmmk, it is necessary to set build configuration to x86
(you might be able to get x64 working if you use rtmidi_64.dll in
managed-midi/lib, but I never got it working.)
